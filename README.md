# film-farm

- is a basic web application used to look up and compare movies.
- Fetches data from OMDb API and renders detailed information to end users. 
- Does not claim ownership to any data/ information rendered on the application.
- Was built on vanilla javascript, HTML and CSS.

## Application Usability

This application is simple to use

- Visit the web-link https://film-farm-ten.vercel.app
- Under the 'Search' bar, input your desired film to find.
- You should see a dropdown of suggested or similar results to your search input.
- You can scroll up or down the dropdown and click to see the film statistics in a column.
- If you search on both bars, you get two columns comparing each statistic row against row.
- The better 'stat' displays a green background- while the other, displays yellow.
- Compared statistics that are inconclusive, display green.
- When a statistic is unavailable, it should display "N/A"


## Application Scalability

This application is easily scalable in many ways. Let's think about implementing on the current functionality.

- Styling: to improve the user interface and experience, proper styling is required.
- More UI: added features can make this app more interactive. i.e. background, cards, etc
- Responsive: this application can be more responsive to different devices and screen sizes.
